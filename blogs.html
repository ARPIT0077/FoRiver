              Let's define productivity. Productivity is a measure of efficiency of a person completing a task.
              We often assume that productivity means getting more things done each day. Wrong. 
              Productivity is getting important things done consistently.
              And no matter what you are working on, there are only a few things that are truly imporrtant.
              Being productive is about maintaining a steady, average speed on a few things, not maximum speed on everything.

             More Productivity Ideas.Most productivity strategies focus on short-term efficiency: 
              how to manage your to-do list effectively, how to get more done each morning, how to shorten your weekly meetings,
              and so on. These are all reasonable ideas.
              We often fail to realize, however, that there are certain strategic choices we need to make if we want to maximize 
              our productivity for the long-term. In these articles below, I break down some ideas about long-term productivity.

              <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base" style="color: black;" style="font-size: larger;">Step 1: Manage your energy, not your time.
              If you take a moment to think about it, you’ll probably realize that you are better at doing certain tasks at certain times.
               What type of energy do you have in the morning? Afternoon? Evening? 
              Determine what tasks each energy level and time of day are best suited for.
            </p>

              <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base" style="color: black;" style="font-size: larger;">
              Step 2: Prepare the night before.
              If you only do one thing each day then spend a few minutes each night organizing your to–do list for tomorrow. 
              When I do it right, I’ll outline the article I’m going to write the next day and develop a short list of the most important 
              items for me to accomplish. It takes 10 minutes that night and saves 3 hours the next day.</p>

                Set your alarm and go through your normal morning habits like you would if you were going into the office. When you get ready for the day, it can signal you to transition your home environment into your workspace.
                
                2. Set daily and weekly goals

                Here are again the 14 ways to get an INSTANT attention boost:
                Stop multitasking and focus on one task at a time.
                Take short breaks every 20 minutes or so.
                Declutter your space (the less clutter, the more attention)
                Listen to relaxing music WITHOUT lyrics.
                Try out some smart drugs (smart caffeine is a good start)
